## Reproduction
This repository contains dockerfile for building docker image with our experiments.
To build image you need R packages used by our scrips. All binaries for Linux are available at: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fat2prc3uff6qpz/packages.tar?dl=0)
Put downloaded archive packages.tar into root directory of this repository and use docker to build image.
